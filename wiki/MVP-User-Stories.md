## User Stories for MVP

### Task creation
As a busy adult, I want to add tasks with relevant details like title, description, and due date so that I can keep track of important responsibilities without relying on memory or scattered notes.

I would use this feature by
- Opening the OnTrack app.
- Tapping the “Add Task” button.
- Entering the task details.
- Assigning it to a category.
- Saving the task to my dashboard.

### Category management
As a user with diverse responsibilities, I want to create and delete custom categories so that I can organize my tasks in a way that makes sense for my life (e.g., Home, Health, Travel).

### Reminder system
As someone who often forgets deadlines, I want to add multiple reminders to each task so that I’m notified well in advance and again on the day the task is due.

### Task dashboard
As a user managing many responsibilities, I want to see all my upcoming tasks in one place so that I can plan my week and avoid missing anything important.

### Document attachment (Nice to Have)
As a homeowner, I want to attach documents like receipts and warranties to my tasks so that I can easily reference them when scheduling maintenance or comparing service costs.

### Template-based task creation (Nice to Have)
As someone unsure of what tasks I should be tracking, I want to use pre-generated templates so that I can discover and add common tasks I might otherwise forget.

### Calendar sync (Could Have)
As a user who already uses Google Calendar, I want my OnTrack tasks to sync with my calendar so that I don’t have to manage two separate systems.

### Offline access (Could Have)
As a frequent camper, I want to access my tasks and reminders even when I’m offline so that I can stay organized no matter where I am.
