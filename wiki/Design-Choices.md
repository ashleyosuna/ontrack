# Design Choices
Centralized area to record design choices and keep the website design consistent. These design choices are in flux as we consult with customers to get feedback.

### Core Guidelines

| Guideline | Reasoning |
|----------------|------------|
| Minimalist | Reduce clutter so that users feel more in control and calm when managing tasks, and can easily see what responsibilities are upcoming |
| Mobile-friendly | The app is designed to be used as a mobile app so that users can receive notifications |

### Icons

* Icons will not be emojis, to distance ourselves from AI-aesthetics that users (including most members of the group) might be growing tired of

### Colours
TBD
