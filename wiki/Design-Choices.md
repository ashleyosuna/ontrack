# Design Choices
Centralized area to record design choices and keep the website design consistent. These design choices are in flux as we consult with customers to get feedback.

### Core Guidelines

| Guideline | Reasoning |
|----------------|------------|
| Minimalist | Reduce clutter so that users feel more in control and calm when managing tasks, and can easily see what responsibilities are upcoming |
| Mobile-friendly | The app is designed to be used as a mobile app so that users can receive notifications |

### Icons
* Icons will not be emojis, to distance ourselves from AI-aesthetics that users (including most members of the group) might be growing tired of
* Show category icons with each reminder on the home screen, so that it's clear what realm of one's life a task is in

### Smart Suggestions
* Put smart suggestions on the main page, so that users see it immediately and can 'know what they don't know'
* Collapse smart suggestions, so that users aren't overwhelmed by the volume
* Allow users to dismiss or snooze smart suggestions, so that they don't get cluttered
* Remove arrows and allow users to swipe through smart suggestions (more intuitive on mobile)

### Logo
* Make the logo as simple as possible for better look on a phone app screen
* On the product page, make logo larger and more central

### Colours
* #37A6B2
* #57499A

### Other Design Choices
* Remove all pop-ups (doesn't look good on mobile)
* Only have 4 tabs available at the bottom of the screen (too much looks cluttered)
* In the calendar view, show how many tasks are due on each day, not every single task (looks cleaner, distinguishes from other calendars)
* In the Reminders tab, organize tasks by month, for more clarity and control
