# Customer Validation Takeaways

To gather feedback on the current iteration of our application OnTrack, we conducted 5 customer interviews. These interviews were conducted on-campus, so participants were mostly younger university students. The interviews roughly followed the following structure:

1. Introducing the app and its intended purpose.
2. The user was given the app starting from the onboarding screen.
3. The user was free to explore the application while the interviewers observed.

While the interview was mostly unscripted to allow for a more fluid conversation and gather feedback guided by the customer, the following questions were asked:

* Are there any features that you would find particularly helpful or that you would like to see in such an application?
* Is there anything that stands out to you, whether it is a positive or a negative thing?
* If this app was offered as a one-time payment on the app store, how much would you be willing to pay for it?

The following are some of the main takeaways we gathered from these interviews:

## Desire for customization
	
Two interviewees mentioned that customization would be important for them in an app like this, as the way that each person keeps track of their responsibilities may vary from person to person. One person specifically mentioned that they would like to customize aspects of the user interface, such as the color scheme. These interviewees appreciated the ability to have custom categories.

## Categories
	
People seemed to enjoy the categorization of tasks.	 One person particularly liked that on the home page they could clearly identify which category a task belonged to based on the icons. Users also mentioned that they liked the Categories tab, and being able to go into specific categories and view the relevant tasks. One of the interviewees said that the fact that things are organized into categories is the main improvement over a spreadsheet. However, one person was confused about the meaning or relevance of the “Personal” category; since the purpose of this application is to keep track of “adulting” responsibilities, we might want to remove this category altogether, and users who would like such a category still have the option to create it.

## Payment
	
Overall, the interviewees were receptive to the idea of a one-time payment, with one person specifically mentioning that they thought this was better over a subscription-based payment. However, one interviewee did say that they do not generally pay for their applications and that if they were to pay for this application it would have to be a low fee, as there are free alternatives. When asked how much they would be willing to pay two people said they would pay $1, two people said between $10 and $15, and one person was unsure whether they would pay for it.
 
## Onboarding experience
	
While no explicit comments were made about the onboarding screen, we noticed that some of the interviewees were confused as to why, after answering the onboarding questions, their home pages did not have any tasks and were momentarily confused as to what to do next. This can be addressed by providing a simple tutorial that indicates to new users what each section of the app is meant to do. Additionally, having pre-loaded tasks based on the categories the user selected might also be helpful.


Overall, the people interviewed thought that an application like these would be helpful for them, as “adulting” responsibilities are harder to keep track of. People seemed enthusiastic and enjoyed the experience provided by the user interface. The main limitation of these interviews is that they were of a short duration, so we cannot observe how people would integrate the application into their everyday lives over an extended period of time.
