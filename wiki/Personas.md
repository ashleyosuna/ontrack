## Persona 1:

**Name:** Adulting Abigail
**Age:** 28
**Occupation:** RMT
**Housing:** Lives with roommates; manages shared expenses (rent and utilities).
**Personality:** Type B, forgetful, often loses track of tasks, recognizes her disorganization and wants to improve it.

Abigail, or Abby as her friends call her, is 28 years old. She comes from a blended family with a brother and sister, and a half-brother. The siblings are all fairly close, but being one of the middle kids Abby always felt like she had to prove herself. Her older siblings are now married and starting families of her own, but Abby is still single and living with roommates. With her 29th birthday around the corner and 30 looming closer, lately she’s been feeling left behind in life.
Abby has always been a bit of a dreamer. School took her a little longer than some people, because she didn’t exactly take the straightest path through post secondary. She’s already had a few different jobs, but she’s currently pretty happy with her gig as a registered massage therapist. She works at a spa, so her cash flow isn’t as strong as it would be if she was running her own business, and her loftiest goal is to make that a reality before she turns 30. Abby realizes though that this means she’d have to be a lot more organized than she currently is, to be able to take on everything that comes with having a small business. She also realizes that she’s going to have to invest in herself, and wants to start being smarter with her finances.
Right now, Abby struggles with remembering the day to day details. There’s just so much going on in her social life! Her friends know to message her (probably more than once) on the day they have plans with her because she’s well known for forgetting them. Yes, Abby tries… she uses her phone’s calendar to try to keep track of things, but she finds it too easy to accidentally ignore one of the million notifications she gets. Abby doesn't like this about herself, she feels incredibly bad when she stands up her friends. She also hates it when she has to pay for a missed appointment.
Two years ago Abby bought a new-to-her car (that isn’t exactly new) and her dad’s been dealing with it for her whenever it has issues. Abby really doesn’t want to have to rely on her parents anymore, so she’s written down most of what he’s said in her Notes app. Still, Abby struggles to remember to look at the notes and remember to take it in for its regular maintenance. Last year that really shot her in the foot, when it snowed and her tires were bald - spinning out in her parking lot was terrifying and the taxi took forever to get her to work that day. 
Abby has set herself a goal, she wants to be more organized in her personal life before she turns 29, so that she has a year to focus on becoming more organized in her professional life. She knows there are important life details she should be keeping better track of, and wants to find a better system than the scattered multi-app approach she’s been using. She’s incredibly sick of the million half baked lists she has in a million different places. Abby also wants to have a better grasp of what exactly the important details she should be keeping track of are.

### Goals
- Better organization in her personal life in the next couple months
- Starting her own business by the age of 30
- Better management of her finances
- Better care of her car
- Better understanding of what she should be aware of in terms of her responsibilities
- Less time worrying that she's missing or has forgotten something
- Not to forget about appointments


### Pain Points
- Too many notifications from multiple apps, making them easily ignored
- Very easy to forget to write things down as it's not easy in the moment to know where (which app) to input things into and it's annoying to do input in most apps.
- Not enough notifications about certain things - like her car maintenance

### Current Workarounds
- Calendar app
- Notes app (especially for her car)
- Reminders app (when she remembers to use it)
- Emailing herself details of things... but she has so many unopened emails.
- A stack on her desk of "important things to take care of" she's received in the mail

### How the App Helps 
- Single solution for all of her responsibility tracking
- Suggestions as to what she should be keeping track of
- Notifications that are within her control
- Easy task entry, quick uploading of any paper documents she receives

### Quotes: 
- "Oh no, I'm so sorry! I didn't realize I had an appointment today! Can we reschedule??"
- "I promise I won't forget this time."
- "I know I wrote this down somewhere..."
- "I was supposed to do what?!"

## Persona 2: 

**Name:** Fiona  
**Age:** 40  

Fiona is a new homeowner and is overwhelmed with the number of things she now has to add to the existing list of important dates and tasks she has to keep track of. Fiona doesn’t want to have a pile of documents lying around her new home, and wants a more in depth way to keep track of her tasks than her existing system using Google Calendar. Fiona is a single woman and isn’t very handy. She doesn’t yet know all of the different tasks she needs to do with a new home but wants to be sure she’s maintaining her investment. Fiona would like suggestions of home maintenance she should schedule, and reminders to schedule them as well as reminders the day the maintenance is scheduled. As a single woman Fiona is afraid of being overcharged for maintenance she doesn’t understand so she wants to keep track of how much she’s spending on specific jobs to compare pricing with past records. Fiona spends her free time dancing, and doesn’t want to spend any more time than necessary setting up and tracking her home needs as she’d rather be in the studio. 

### Goals
- Stay on top of homeownership responsibilities  
- Avoid clutter and paper documents  
- Maintain her property investment with minimal effort  
- Track spending on maintenance and repairs  
- Spend more time dancing and less time organizing  

### Pain Points
- Overwhelmed by new home-related tasks  
- Doesn’t know what maintenance she should be doing  
- Worried about being overcharged for services  
- Finds Google Calendar too basic for her needs  
- Doesn’t want to waste time setting up complex systems  

### How the App Helps 
- Provides templates for common home maintenance tasks  
- Sends reminders before and on the day of scheduled tasks  
- Allows her to attach receipts and track service costs  
- Offers tips and timelines for tasks she’s unfamiliar with  
- Keeps everything in one place so she can focus on her passions

## Persona 3

**Name:** Geoff  
**Age:** 26  

Geoff moved out on his own after university but has been relying on his mom to tell him when he needs to take care of important tasks like doctors appointments, dental cleaning, licence renewals and insurance renewals. His mom is fed up with tracking her son's adulting needs and has told him he’s now on his own. Geoff has no idea what he’s supposed to be tracking as an adult and how often he needs to be scheduling or updating important ‘adulting’ things. Geoff is addicted to his phone and wants to have one app that can tell him when he needs to do these things, and what these ‘adulting things’ actually are. He wants to have multiple reminders as he knows he’s going to ignore them when he’s busy, and he wants reliable notifications because he loves to go camping and often is offline when he’s out in the woods. 

### Goals
- Learn what adult responsibilities he needs to manage  
- Get reliable reminders for important tasks  
- Stay organized without relying on his mom  
- Have everything in one app on his phone  
- Avoid missing deadlines while offline  

### Pain Points
- Doesn’t know what to track or when  
- Easily ignores reminders when distracted  
- Often offline while camping or traveling  
- Feels overwhelmed by adult responsibilities  
- Wants a simple system that doesn’t require setup  

### How the App Helps 
- Offers a checklist of common adulting tasks  
- Sends multiple reminders and notifications  
- Stores important dates and documents in one place  
- Works offline with cached reminders  
- Helps him build independence and confidence
