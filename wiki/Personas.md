## Persona 1: 

**Name:** Fiona  
**Age:** 40  

Fiona is a new homeowner and is overwhelmed with the number of things she now has to add to the existing list of important dates and tasks she has to keep track of. Fiona doesn’t want to have a pile of documents lying around her new home, and wants a more in depth way to keep track of her tasks than her existing system using Google Calendar. Fiona is a single woman and isn’t very handy. She doesn’t yet know all of the different tasks she needs to do with a new home but wants to be sure she’s maintaining her investment. Fiona would like suggestions of home maintenance she should schedule, and reminders to schedule them as well as reminders the day the maintenance is scheduled. As a single woman Fiona is afraid of being overcharged for maintenance she doesn’t understand so she wants to keep track of how much she’s spending on specific jobs to compare pricing with past records. Fiona spends her free time dancing, and doesn’t want to spend any more time than necessary setting up and tracking her home needs as she’d rather be in the studio. 

### Goals
- Stay on top of homeownership responsibilities  
- Avoid clutter and paper documents  
- Maintain her property investment with minimal effort  
- Track spending on maintenance and repairs  
- Spend more time dancing and less time organizing  

### Pain Points
- Overwhelmed by new home-related tasks  
- Doesn’t know what maintenance she should be doing  
- Worried about being overcharged for services  
- Finds Google Calendar too basic for her needs  
- Doesn’t want to waste time setting up complex systems  

### How the App Helps 
- Provides templates for common home maintenance tasks  
- Sends reminders before and on the day of scheduled tasks  
- Allows her to attach receipts and track service costs  
- Offers tips and timelines for tasks she’s unfamiliar with  
- Keeps everything in one place so she can focus on her passions

## Persona 2

**Name:** Geoff  
**Age:** 26  

Geoff moved out on his own after university but has been relying on his mom to tell him when he needs to take care of important tasks like doctors appointments, dental cleaning, licence renewals and insurance renewals. His mom is fed up with tracking her son's adulting needs and has told him he’s now on his own. Geoff has no idea what he’s supposed to be tracking as an adult and how often he needs to be scheduling or updating important ‘adulting’ things. Geoff is addicted to his phone and wants to have one app that can tell him when he needs to do these things, and what these ‘adulting things’ actually are. He wants to have multiple reminders as he knows he’s going to ignore them when he’s busy, and he wants reliable notifications because he loves to go camping and often is offline when he’s out in the woods. 

### Goals
- Learn what adult responsibilities he needs to manage  
- Get reliable reminders for important tasks  
- Stay organized without relying on his mom  
- Have everything in one app on his phone  
- Avoid missing deadlines while offline  

### Pain Points
- Doesn’t know what to track or when  
- Easily ignores reminders when distracted  
- Often offline while camping or traveling  
- Feels overwhelmed by adult responsibilities  
- Wants a simple system that doesn’t require setup  

### How the App Helps 
- Offers a checklist of common adulting tasks  
- Sends multiple reminders and notifications  
- Stores important dates and documents in one place  
- Works offline with cached reminders  
- Helps him build independence and confidence
