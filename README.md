# OnTrack

**OnTrack** is a mobile application designed to help you stay on top of life’s essential tasks — all in one place. It’s more than just another calendar or to-do list. OnTrack is your digital filing cabinet with a built-in assistant that reminds you when and how to get things done.

---

## Project Description

We’re building **OnTrack**, a centralized app that helps users manage tasks that often fall through the cracks — the ones you forget to add to your calendar or scribble into a notes app.

With **OnTrack**, you can:
- Track important deadlines like passport renewals, insurance updates, and bill payments  
- Store and attach documents directly to task entries  
- Use pre-generated templates to discover tasks you didn’t know you needed to track  
- Get reminders with best practices and timelines for complex tasks (e.g., how long it takes to renew your passport)  
- Sync with your existing calendar for seamless integration  

Our goal is to reduce mental clutter and help people stay organized with a robust, visual task manager that’s built for real life.
